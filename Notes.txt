        probability space:
            the space of all possible (probable) outcomes, of which an event(händelse) is a subset(delmängd)
            of the probability space.

            "En händelse är en delmängd av utfallsrummet."
            "Händelsen godkända betyg är en delmängd av S."

            definition of an event:
                an event can be seen as an array of of multiple possible outcomes. e.g the event "passing grade" can be
                A B C D & E, all of which are part of the subset(delmängd) of S(the probability space).

                An event with only one element (e.g one index. one outcome) is called a "simple event".

Chap 3:

    remember/rules:
        1. When calculatikng the mass function, disregard x's even exponent sum reaches 0.
        2. When calculatikng the mass function and inverting, dont count the first diggit of x
            (e.g if P(x >= 5), skip 5 when inverting)

    Binomial distribution:
        application:
            the probability of sales happening under one shift, where the probability
            of a single sale is x.

        constants:
            n = num of tries
            p = probability per try
            q = for equation, not important
            x = what where tryna calculate

        E(X) = "Väntevärdet för binomialfördelning"
        E(V) = "Standardavvikelse för binomialfördelning" but remove square root
        S(V) = "Standardavvikelse för binomialfördelning"

        # Calculate P(X >= 4)
        # Run "massfunktionen för binomialfördelning" equation x times,
        # Where x follows the given expression, than sum all the output numbers.


    Poisson distribution:
        application:
            A formula used to estimate the value of P(X = n) for binomial distributions where
            n > 10
            p < 0.1
            aka
            0.01 < E(X) < 50
            
            note: remember, E(X) = n * p

            which makes calculating the varius Binomial distribution values very difficult or
            simply impossible.

        constants:
            µ = n * p
            X = given
    

    Geometric distribution:
        application:
            the number of calls needed to get 3 sales under one shift, where the probability
            of a single sale is x.

            p
            x
    
        E(X) = "Väntevärdet för geometrisk fördelning"

    Hypergeometric distribution:
        application:
            the probability of getting 3 in a row, given that we know how many sales we would randomly get
            if we called 10 ppl, where the probability of getting a single sale is x.
            (remember ball problem)

        constants:
            n = number of bernoulli trials (e.g num balls picked up total)
            R = number of black balls
            N = total number of balls (probabilities)
            x = number of black balls you picked up in a row

        # Note that if x = 4, than what where really trying to do is calculate the probability of
        # getting 4 black balls in a row given that you pull each ball out one round at a time.
        # to do this, we need to calculate the probabilities of getting 4, 3, 2 and 1 black balls
        # respectively in a row, than sum the probabilities. What where effectively doing is
        # re-calculating the probability for each possible event (4, 3, 2, or 1 balls) in order to
        # obtain the probability.
    
        E(X) = "Väntevärdet för hypergeometrisk fördelning"

        S(X) = "Standardavvikelse för hypergeometrisk fördelning"


Chap 4:
    remember/rules:
        1. When dealing with probabilities, you can flip the sign (e.g > to <)
            by getting the complement (e.g 1 - P(Z > 1.41) = 0.0793)
        
        2. When dealing with values (e.g P(Z > z) = 0.75), you can flip the sign of z to flip the </>.
            This works because the normal distribution is symmetric.
        
        3. when breaking out things like P(-0.18 < Z < 1.55), break out with Z's first.
            e.g: P(Z < -0.18) & P(Z < 1.41)
        
    Solve for:

        P(Z < -0.55):
            use the table, thats it


        P(Z > 1.41):
            Use the table, get the complement to flip sign


        P(-0.18 < Z < 1.55):
            breakout into
            P(Z < -0.18)
            P(Z < 1.55)

            calculate both and subtract the larger larger slice by the smaller in order to get the middle slice
            0.9394 - 0.4286 = 0.5108


        P(Z > z) = 0.75:
            use the table, get value of opposit sign
            P(Z < 0.67) = 0.75

            Flip the sign by simply flipping the sign of the z value
            P(Z > -0.67) = 0.75


        P(-z < Z < z) = 0.57:
            use
                P(Z < z) = a + 1 / 2
            to convert to
                P(Z < z) = 0.785
            
            feed in values
            P(-0.785 < Z < 0.785) = 0.57


        μ = 32, σ = 5, P(X̄ > 35):

            Convert to a standard normal distribution by using the "Standard z-värde" equation
            (Note: equation only used for populations, not samples)
            P(Z > 0.6)

            Solve
            1 - P(Z > 0.6) = 0.2743


Chap 5:
    remember:
        write everything down, find keywords

    Solve for:
        # P(X̄ > 243)
        Convert to a standard normal distribution by using the
        "CENTRALA GRÄNSVÄRDESSATSEN => standardiserad stickprovsmedelvärde ..." equation
        (Note: equation only used for samples, not population)
        P(Z > 0.75)

        Solve like usual
